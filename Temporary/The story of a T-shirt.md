# The story of a T-shirt

Lagos, Nigeria—Yaba market is busy, hot and dusty. People are looking around the second-hand shops, picking through piles of old clothes, and they’re all searching for deals.
拉各斯，尼日利亚——雅巴市场繁忙、炎热且尘土飞扬。人们在二手店里四处张望，从成堆的旧衣服中挑选，都在寻找便宜货。

The market is flooded with cheap clothes from America and Europe, and they usually sell out fairly quickly.
市场上充斥着来自美国和欧洲的便宜衣服，而且通常很快就会卖光。

“These clothes make people’s dreams come true,” says Abeke, a shop owner. “Everyone wears them. When they put them on, you can’t tell the difference between the rich and the poor.”
“这些衣服让人们的梦想成真，”店主阿贝克说。“每个人都穿它们。当他们穿上时，你无法分辨富人和穷人。”

At the front of Abeke’s store is a cotton T-shirt with the words “Get Real”. It’s picked up by a young guy who looks at it carefully.
阿贝克店前有一件印有“实事求是”字样的棉T恤。一位年轻人小心地看着它。

He tries it on and smiles—it fits him and it looks good. It’s a simple T-shirt, but it has a long story.
他试穿了一下，笑了——它很合身，看起来不错。这是一件简单的T恤，但它有一个漫长的故事。

A few years ago, the T-shirt started life in a cotton field in Uzbekistan. The cotton was watered every day and harmful chemicals were used to kill insects in the field.
几年前，这件T恤从乌兹别克斯坦的一个棉田开始了它的生命。棉花每天都要浇水，并使用有害的化学品来杀死田里的昆虫。

As the cotton grew, a young woman called Feruza picked it. She sweated in the field for ten to twelve hours every day in temperatures of over 30°C, but she was paid very little.
随着棉花的生长，一个叫费鲁扎的年轻女人摘了它。她每天在超过30°C的高温下在田间工作十到十二个小时，但报酬很低。

Sometimes the chemicals hurt her eyes. Next, the cotton was flown to India.
有时这些化学品会伤害她的眼睛。接下来，这些棉花被运往印度。

The T-shirt was made in a tiny factory in the Indian port city of Mumbai. There were 20 adults in it, five children and no air conditioning.
这件T恤是在印度港口城市孟买的一家小工厂制作的。里面有20个成年人，5个孩子，而且没有空调。

The adults made the T-shirts and the children checked them. The finished T-shirt was sent to a huge discount shop in the UK.
成年人制作T恤，孩子们检查它们。完成的T恤被送到英国的一家大型折扣店。

The people who shopped there didn’t know where the clothes came from. They didn’t want to spend a lot of money, but they wanted to look good.
在那里购物的人不知道这些衣服来自哪里。他们不想花很多钱，但他们想看起来不错。

The T-shirt was cheap and it was bought by 15-year-old Ryan who liked the words on it.
这件T恤很便宜，被一个喜欢上面文字的15岁男孩瑞恩买走了。

It was washed, worn and ironed and, after a few months, Ryan threw it away.
它被洗过、穿过、熨过，几个月后，瑞恩把它扔掉了。

His mum took it to a charity shop with some other old clothes, which were sold to an export company.
他的妈妈把它和其他一些旧衣服一起带到了一家慈善商店，这些衣服被卖给了一家出口公司。

A few weeks later, the T-shirt made its way to Yaba market in Nigeria.
几周后，这件T恤来到了尼日利亚的雅巴市场。

Back at the market, the young man takes off the T-shirt and looks at the $3 price tag. He hesitates for a moment and then he offers Abeke  1.50 because that’s all the cash he’s got.
回到市场，年轻人脱下T恤，看着3美元的价格标签。他犹豫了一下，然后向阿贝克出价1.50美元，因为他只有这些现金。

Abeke shakes her head. As she hangs up the T-shirt at the front of the shop, the charity shop’s price tag is still on the back: 25p.
阿贝克摇摇头。当她把T恤挂在店前时，慈善商店的价格标签仍在后面：25便士。

The journey of a T-shirt tells many stories. Stories about people, countries and cultures.
一件T恤的旅程讲述了许多故事。关于人们、国家和文化的故事。

Stories about farmers and factory workers. Stories about shopping centres.
关于农民和工厂工人的故事。关于购物中心的故事。

But for most of all, it’s a story about choices, and our choices can make a difference.
但最重要的是，这是一个关于选择的故事，我们的选择可以产生影响。

Do you really need another T-shirt? Do you care where it’s from? What’s the cost to the environment? What’s the human cost?
你真的需要另一件T恤吗？你在乎它来自哪里吗？对环境的成本是什么？人力成本是什么？

Think about it, because our choices could start a new story.
想一想，因为我们的选择可能会开启一个新的故事。
