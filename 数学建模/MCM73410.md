#Modelling 
### 假设
重点：**没有对任何Assumption进行解释**
#### General Assumption
1. *No radical and unpredicted events will occur, causing utter shifting in the population structure.* 过于绝对，可以保留一个很小的概率$p$，然后假设改为：*We consider the possibility of radical and unpredicted events as $p$, the variable $p$ is assigned a value of 1e-8. 
2. *Once an individual has mastered a new language, he becomes a non-native speaker of this language, while remaining all previous identities.* 没有明确说明什么叫'master'一个语言，应该在后续（或者解释中）体现
